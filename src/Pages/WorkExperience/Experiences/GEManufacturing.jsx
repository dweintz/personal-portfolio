        <p>
          In the summer of 2025, I worked as a Supply Chain and Manufacturing
          Intern at GE Aerospace in the Marine and Industrial division. During
          my rotation, I contributed to several projects that improved assembly
          operations for the LM2500 and LM6000 engines.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Key projects and accomplishments:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Designed an ergonomic kit cart system for engine mechanics as part
              of a new kitting initiative. Collaborated directly with mechanics
              to prototype and standardize the cart design to improve workflow
              and accessibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed and implemented a labeling system for a 2Bin hardware
              project. Created a color-coded and barcode scanning label design
              for over 4,000 bins to streamline part identification and
              organization at the plant and distribution center.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built a Python module to analyze an excess hardware inventory of
              more than 30,000 parts. Designed a command-line interface for
              querying by engine subassembly, identifying high-frequency part
              numbers, and exporting cost and usage data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Worked with a team to facilitate the return of hundreds of excess
              and non-conforming parts to suppliers. Communicated with vendors
              to resolve issues and ensure efficient processing.
            </li>
          </ul>
