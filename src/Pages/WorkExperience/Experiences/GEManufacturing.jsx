            <p>
                In the summer of 2025, I worked as a Supply Chain and 
                Manufacturing Intern at GE Aerospace in the Marine and 
                Industrial division. During my rotation, I contributed 
                to several projects that improved assembly operations 
                for the LM2500 and LM6000 engines.

            <p>
                Key projects and accomplishments:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Designed an ergonomic kit cart system for engine 
                        mechanics as part of a new kitting initiative. 
                        Collaborated directly with mechanics to prototype 
                        and standardize the cart design to improve workflow 
                        and accessibility.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed and implemented a labeling system for a 
                        2Bin hardware project. Created a color-coded and 
                        barcode scanning label design for over 4,000 bins 
                        to streamline part identification and organization 
                        at the plant and distribution center.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Built a Python module to analyze an excess 
                        hardware inventory of more than 30,000 parts. 
                        Designed a command-line interface for querying 
                        by engine subassembly, identifying high-frequency 
                        part numbers, and exporting cost and usage data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Worked with a team to facilitate the return of 
                        hundreds of excess and non-conforming parts to 
                        suppliers. Communicated with vendors to resolve 
                        issues and ensure efficient processing.
                    </li>
                </ul>
