        <p>
          I’m Donny, a Computer Engineering Student at Purdue University, 
          concentrating in AI and machine learning. I’ll be graduating 
          in May 2026 and am actively seeking opportunities in software 
          and computer engineering. My primary focus is computer vision, 
          though I’m also passionate about software systems and 
          application development.

          I built this website using React as a way to explore front-end 
          development and UI/UX design. It’s still a work in progress, 
          and I plan on adding more content and features soon. In the 
          meantime, feel free to browse through the site to learn more 
          about my experience, projects, and interests outside of work.
